# 2D-Image-Proccesing-on-Writing-Table
Image Processing includes changing the nature of an image in order to improve its pictorial information for human interpretation,. Digital image processing is a subset of the electronic domain wherein the image is converted to an array of small integers, called pixels, representing a physical quantity such as scene radiance, stored in a digital memory, and processed by computer or other digital hardware.

Although the use of image processing increases every year, its use is observed in many areas from traffic to defense industry.

In this project i tried to process image from a 2 dimensional matrix. The program examines the figure drawn on a frame, makes the same drawing on another area, and determines the line breaks on the drawn figure. When the tolerance distance is specified, it can calculate the line breaks again according to the specified value.
